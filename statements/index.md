# Sarah Allen

The fellowship currently relies on extraordinary effort and sometimes serendipitous connections by the individual fellows.  We have the potential to magnify that effort dramatically by connecting the network of past fellows to current fellows, as well as developing a network of private innovators who want to contribute with open source or industry partnerships, when appropriate.  We can also play a unique role in recruiting candidates for the fellowship.  I’d like to help develop a resilient and sustainable foundation to support the work of current and future fellows, and am open to any ideas to make that happen.

# Ben Balter

Ben Balter is DC-based attorney, entrepreneur, and software developer, currently serving as GitHub's Government Evangelist, bringing his passion for open source, open data, and open government to agencies around the world. Ben was a member of the inaugural PIF class, reimagining the role of technology in brokering the relationship between citizens and government as part of the MyGov project, and previously worked in the US CIO's office drafting the Digital Strategy and Open Data Policies. As a member of the PIF board Ben hopes to establish the alumni association as an institutional on-ramp and off-ramp for each round of PIFs.

# John Fellman

My fellowship was profoundly rewarding. Joining this talented, dedicated cohort was inspiring and I am proud of our accomplishments. I would be honored to serve current and future fellows by helping to guide our foundation.  I have experience as a non-profit board member. I drafted bylaws, resolved conflicts, and created operating plans and budgets.  I have extended my work as a fellow into a permanent position, where I remain committed to government innovation. I am ready to devote the time required to establish our identity and create sustainability. Thank you for your consideration.

# Ian Kalin

"I'm no more qualified than anyone else on this ballot.  I happen to enjoy serving organizations like this and sit on the Board of similar organizations.  Therefore, I promise to provide the right level of guidance while preventing the organization from getting too taxing for stakeholders."

# Jacqueline Kazil 

It’s my privilege to run for the Board of the PIF Foundation. There is great potential to amplify our effectiveness and I look forward to building a stronger community among the PIFs.  I’ve really enjoyed working with incoming fellows to make them feel welcome relocating to DC.  As the founder of the second PyLadies chapter and a pillar of the local tech community, I’ve helped the organization grow to more than 40 chapters worldwide and raised over $70,000. I intend to have a similar impact on the PIF Foundation by directing fundraising campaigns to help support our activities.

# Geoff Mulligan

I am an enthusiastic supporter of the program and of the newly formed Foundation. I would like to work to make sure the program and all of our work leaves an indelible positive mark on America's Government. The Foundation should provide a stable counsel and support to those running the program, including advertising the Fellows and their project and should serve the Alumni by providing opportunities to collaborate, communicate and find ongoing opportunities.  I have served on a few BoDs and have started, run and served on the BoD for a 501c(6) -- the IPSO Alliance -- since 2008. 

# Rob Read

I was a driving force in the creation of the Foundation, working with other to create the bylaws, obtain incorporation, and obtain the tax-deductible status from the IRS. I have served as the interim treasurer.

I will work to: make the website “Tell the story of the PIFs”,
attempt to appoint a powerful and prestigious advisory board,
continue to facilitate fundraising to get us up to about $50K, and
start trying to really support paying for some travel to bring PIF alumni in to talk to existing and incoming PIF classes.

# James Sanders

As a PIF with little technical expertise I had to rely on my ability to amplify the work of partners and bring together diverse groups around shared visions. Being based in the Bay Area, and having experience in the non-profit/foundation world, I believe I would add value and perspective to the Presidential Innovation Fellows Foundation board of directors.  It would be an honor and privilege to continue my PIF journey in this new role. 

# Matt Theall
			
Fellow PIFs, I believe the BOD should have a clear vision moving forward. If elected, I plan to work with the BOD to create a PIF Foundation very similar to The White House Fellows Foundation. The WHF Foundation has been highly successful and we should use lean startup mentality to emulate this group to make rapid progress at the least cost, but with technology focus. My vision is to have the PIF program be similar to what you see here and here.  I have been President of two previous non-profit groups, including starting one from scratch and totally restructuring another.
