    1. **Mandatory Indemnification.** Unless clearly prohibited by law or Section 3 of this Article, the Corporation shall indemnify any person ("Indemnified Person") made, or threatened to be made, a party in any action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or otherwise, including any action by or in the right of the Corporation, by reason of the fact that he or she (or his or her testator or intestate), whether before or after adoption of this Section, (a) is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or (b) in addition is serving or served, in any capacity, at the request of the Corporation, as a director or officer of any other corporation, or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise. The indemnification shall be against all judgments, fines, penalties, amounts paid in settlement (provided the Corporation shall have consented to such settlement) and reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees and costs of investigation, incurred by an Indemnified Person with respect to any such threatened or actual action or proceeding, and any appeal thereof.

    2. **Discretionary Indemnification.** Unless clearly prohibited by law or Section 3 of this Article, the Board may approve indemnification as set forth in Section 1 of this Article or advancement of expenses as set forth in Section 4 of this Article, to a person (or the testator or intestate of a person) who is or was employed by the Corporation or who is or was a volunteer for the Corporation, and who is made, or threatened to be made, a party in any action or proceeding, by reason of the fact of such employment or volunteer activity, including actions undertaken at the request of the Corporation for any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust employee benefit plan or other enterprise.

    3. **Prohibited Indemnification.** The Corporation may not indemnify any person if a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to the Indemnified Person (or to the person whose actions are the basis for the action or proceeding) establishes, or the Board in good faith determines, that such person's acts were committed in bad faith or were the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and were material to the cause of action so adjudicated or that he or she personally gained in fact a financial profit or other advantage to which he or she was not legally entitled. In determining whether and to what extent indemnification is proper, no director with a personal interest in the outcome, or who is a party to such actual or threatened action or proceeding concerning which indemnification is sought, shall participate in such determination.  If a quorum of disinterested directors is not obtainable, the Board shall act only after receiving the opinion in writing of independent legal counsel that indemnification is proper in the circumstances under then applicable law and these bylaws.

    4. **Advancement of Expenses.** The Corporation shall, on request of any Indemnified Person who is or may be entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation, pay or promptly reimburse the Indemnified Person's reasonably incurred expenses in connection with a threatened or actual action or proceeding prior to its final disposition.  However, no such advancement of expenses shall be made unless the Indemnified Person makes a binding, written commitment to repay the Corporation, with interest, for any amount advanced in connection with a claim for which it is ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to indemnification.  

    5. **Insurance.** The Corporation may, but is not required to, purchase Directors and Officers' liability insurance if authorized by the Board. To the extent permitted by law, such insurance may insure the Corporation for any obligation it incurs as a result of this Article or operation of law and it may insure directly the directors, officers, employees or volunteers of the Corporation for liabilities against which they are not entitled to indemnification under this Article as well as for liabilities against which they are not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation.

    6. **Nonexclusive Rights.** The provisions of this Article shall not limit or exclude any other rights to which any person may be entitled under law or contract. The Board of Directors is authorized to enter into agreements on behalf of the Corporation with any director, officer, employee or volunteer providing such person rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses in connection with potential indemnification in addition to the provisions therefore in this Article, subject in all cases to the limitations of Section 3 of this Article.

    1. **Execution of Contracts.** The Board may by resolution authorize any officer or agent to enter into any contract or execute and deliver any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the Corporation, and may impose such restrictions or limitations on the authority as it may in its sole discretion determine are necessary or prudent.

    2. **Loans.** No loans shall be contracted on behalf of the Corporation unless specifically authorized by the Board. No loan may be made to any director or officer, unless permitted by law.

    3. **Checks, Drafts, etc.** All checks, drafts and other orders for the payment of money out of the funds of the Corporation, and all notes or other evidences of indebtedness of the Corporation, shall be signed on behalf of the Corporation in such manner as shall from time to time be determined by resolution of the Board.

    3. **Other Offices.** The Corporation may also have offices at such other places as the Board may from time to time determine or the activities of the Corporation may require.

    4. **Writings.** Whenever in these bylaws there is reference to a communication in writing, such term shall include email or transmission by other means by which the communication may be recorded and printed or saved.

    5. **Compensation.** It is the policy of the Corporation to pay no more than reasonable compensation for services rendered to the Corporation. The Board shall have sole authority to determine the reasonableness of compensation paid by the Corporation to any party.

12. Article 12 — Amendments

    1. **Amendment of the Bylaws.** Amendments to these Bylaws may be made by a majority vote of the Board at any duly held meeting of the Board at which quorum is present, provided that notice of the meeting discloses the amendment of the bylaws to be considered at the meeting, and a written summary of the proposed amendment(s) is included with the notice of meeting.
